## Matrix Calculator using C

This code is a matrix calculator implemented in C. I implemented this code in my first year programming course. The program can do matrix operations to matricies up to 99x99.

Results - single square matrix operations:
| Tranpose: | Determinant: |
| --- | --- |

| Inverse: | Multiply by constant: |
| --- | --- |
| <img src="Results/single square/inverse.png" width="800"/> | <img src="Results/single square/Multi Constant.png" width="800"/> |

| Power: | Trace: |
| --- | --- |
| <img src="Results/single square/Power.png" width="800"/> | <img src="Results/single square/Trace.png" width="800"/> |


Results - two matrices operations:
| Matrix multiplication: | Matrix division: |
| --- | --- |
| <img src="Results/2 Multi/mult.png" width="800"/> | <img src="Results/2 square/division.png" width="800"/> |

| Matrix addition: | Matrix subtraction: |
| --- | --- |
